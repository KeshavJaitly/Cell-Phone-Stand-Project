**Project:** Cell Phone Stand Design and Simulation  
**Tools Used:** SolidWorks, FEA (Finite Element Analysis)

1. **Design and Modeling:**
   - Created a functional cell phone stand using SolidWorks, with design considerations for stability and portability.
   - Focused on **weight and strength optimization**, selecting materials that balanced **structural integrity** with a lightweight design.

2. **Material Selection & Weight Optimization:**
   - Experimented with various materials to ensure adequate stiffness without exceeding weight constraints.
   - Adjusted extrusion thickness from **1.2mm to 2mm** after initial testing showed insufficient weight.

3. **Simulation and FEA Analysis:**
   - Performed Finite Element Analysis to test for **Von Mises stress** and **deflection** under load.
   - Used meshing techniques to simulate realistic conditions, solving issues in meshing and contact definitions for accurate results.

4. **Results and Outcomes:**
   - Achieved minimal deflection under expected load, validating design integrity and stability.
   - Reflected on **challenges** encountered, including troubleshooting meshing issues and adjusting materials to enhance performance.

**Outcome:** Successfully designed a lightweight, stable phone stand, with FEA confirming the designâ€™s robustness under load.
